A little shadow sat hiding in the corner,  
he stares at it, all the while he's mourning her.  
The lightbulb created it; the shadow it cast,  
a void of emptiness; a hollow so vast.

A world unto the space therein,  
a glimpse into the void within.  
A little shadow in his room,  
a little shadow spells his doom.

The thoughts grow louder, louder now.  
As his mind falls darker, darker how?  
The little shadow grows, twists the light,  
dimming it, corrupting it, leaving but fright.

A switch is flipped, a new light illuminates.  
The little shadow recoils, and no longer denigrates.  
His mind lightens up, a gloaming left behind,  
when his friend walks in: a presence to remind.
